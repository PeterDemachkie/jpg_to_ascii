Repository Contents:

    1) README.md: (This file) a brief description of the repository and its contents

    2) PicToAscii.py: A python program which takes a jpg image and turns it into ascii art. 

Description:

    jpg_to_ascii is essentially what is stated in the title: a program that converts jpg images into ascii text. I wrote this program in python because it was all I knew how to use at the time and it was just a simple project. Someday I will probably update this to work for other image types, but for now it just works for jpgs. Another improvement to make would be for the program to automatically open the new ascii file.

How To:

    After downloading the python script (jgp_to_ascii.py) run:

    $ python3 PicToAscii.py <jpgfilename>.jpg

    in a directory that contains both the python script as well as the jpg

    The script will have created a new file in this directory named <jpgfilename>Ascii.txt
